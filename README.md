This DIY 3-phase energy monitor leverages three PZEM004T v3.0 modules to measure voltage, current, power, and energy consumption for each phase independently. It seamlessly integrates with Home Assistant via an ESPHome or MQTT-based setup, providing real-time data visualization and monitoring. Ideal for tracking energy usage in homes or small businesses, it supports custom automations and alerts. Designed for reliability and flexibility, it offers an affordable and open-source solution for comprehensive energy management.
